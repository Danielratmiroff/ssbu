# Super Smash Bros Ultimate Companion ðŸŽ®.

I like video games and I'm a huge fan of Super Smash Bros, thus I decided to create a simple app where I could know more about each character and it had to be mobile-first focus, so that I could check the best picks against different opponents while the game is on ðŸ˜„

### Overview

With a simple UI, you can search for a specific character to see their:

- General stats
- Good against characters
- Bad against characters

The app should be appealing to my fellow super smash gamers, therefore, it had to have a good UI design
